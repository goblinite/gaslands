This is my first Arduino project.  My goal was to build an electronic gear tracker that could be mounted in a piece of functional terrain for the game.
I opted for an LCD display beaue they are easy to wire and code for and small enough that I could easily mount in a piece of craftwood.
The original version had only the LCD display.  V2 includes a "traffic light" function triggered by an additional switch.
Added the traffic light because I had the parts and some open pins on the board.

Parts list:
Arduino Uno with 9v battery connection
3 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
1 10k Pot
3 momentary push button switches (off-on)
1 toggle switch
3 10k resistors
